This is a project that analyzes 500 sales transactions across 4 regions, with 5 products, and across 4 quarters to find revenue trends and business insights

Questions Analyzed
1. Which region generated the most total revenue?
2. Which product sells the most units?
3. Do higher discounts lead to more units sold?
4. Which quarter had the highest revenue?

Key Findings:
1. The North region had the highest total revenue which was $1,607,853.
2. The phone was the best selling product, selling 2,855 units
3. Higher discounts did not lead to higher sales.  The 15% lead to the most sales while the 20% actually had a dip in sales.
4. Quarter 2 had the most revenue, which was  $1,621,924

The dataset was generated by AI, specifically CLAUDE.AI. I did use AI to periodically check my approach and guide me in the right direction
